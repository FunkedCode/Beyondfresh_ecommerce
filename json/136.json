      "description": "While it could cause gastrointestinal issues in sensitive individuals, xanthan gum seems to be safe in adults. Infants, however, should not be given products with xanthan gum, as there have been cases of infants dying after <a href=\"http://www.cspinet.org/reports/chemcuisine.htm#gums\">developing necrotizing enterocolitis</a>, potentially as a result of consuming a product made from xanthan gum. Xanthan gum can be made from different sources, so if you are allergic to corn, wheat, soy, or dairy, check with the manufacturer before consuming a product with xanthan gum."
